FOLDER CONTENTS
RUN.sh
 ~ Used to run the project
./Kinepolis
 ~ Contains python scripts that process input and following folders:
	./Contracts
	 ~ Contains contracts for all modules
	 ~ ADT contracts have been put in a separate folder
	./Input
	 	./ADTgraph
		~ Contains input files for ADT visualization
		./Kinepolis
		~ Contains input files for Kinepolis Ticket System
	./Output
		./ADTgraph
		~ .dot files generated by ADT visualization are placed here
		./KinepolisLog
		~ .html log files generated by ADT Kinepolis Ticket System are placed here
	./System
	 ~ Contains .py files for all modules
	 ~ ADT files have been put in a separate folder

USAGE
1. Place any additional input files into the corresponding folder inside .Kinepolis/Input
  —> .txt files for Kinepolis Ticket System go into .Kinepolis/Input/Kinepolis
     (system.txt that was provided and some additional files are already provided)
  —> .txt files for ADT visualization go into .Kinepolis/Input/ADTgraph
     (adt.txt that was provided and some additional files are already provided)
2. Run the RUN.sh script directly from the folder the files are extracted into, when using a longer 
   path to RUN.sh it might not find the files needed for correct execution
   (when running on a new system we need to make the shell script executable first)
3. Once the script has been run follow the steps on screen
4. When running the script again there is no need to clear the output folder as you will be asked by
   the scripts if they should do this for you

WARNING
! DO NOT alter the folder structure within the Kinepolis folder, this might break the system !

ADDITIONAL FEATURES
~ if you want to use custom timeslots in the Kinepolis Ticket System you can do so by:
  1. Provide custom timeslots before the plays init in the input-.txt files by using
     following syntax: tijdsslot ID TIME
     —> ID should be an integer
     —> TIME takes any format e.g. 14.00, 14:00, 2:00pm, etc. as long as it contains no spaces
  2. Answer “N“ when asked if you would like to use default timeslots, if you answer “Y” custom
     timeslots in the file will be ignored

~ if no reservations are made for a movie, the movie gets cancelled. This is indicated by the letter
  “C” in the .html log file


NOT IMPLEMENTED/UNFINISHED
~ Visualize for 2-3-4-tree and red-black tree not finished
